# Stock-Market-Prediction
• Objective of this project was to implement all the machine learning models on given sets of data and draw a
conclusion related to model performance.

• Developed code for predicting the closing price of the NIFTY50 index using machine learning models and data
from the previous 20 years.

• Implemented machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, support
vector machine model (SVM), decision tree model, and artificial neural network model (ANN) for stock
market prediction.

• Achieved high accuracy with ANN and Random Forest models on the given return strategy.
